### Spot - Futures Arbitrage

In addition to the "traditional" crypto arbitrage, another popular arbitrage strategy is by buying a cryptocurrency on a spot market and at the same time holding a short position in the perpetual futures market. This strategy only works when the funding rate of the perpetual market is positive. This way, we will get our profit from the funding rate and the market volatility will not have any effect on our profitability/loss.
